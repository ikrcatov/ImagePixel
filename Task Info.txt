CODE CHALLENGE

Please develop a very simple application that accepts two image files as input (see attached files). 
The application should include a graphical user interface that displays both images side by side. 
The user should be able to select a location in one image. Using a method of your choice (e.g. block matching), 
the corresponding location in the other image shall be identified and highlighted 
(the images show the same scene from roughly the same view point). 
By location we mean a pixel and its surrounding pixels. 
This problem can be solved in image space, you don't have to take into account the scene geometry 
and can assume that there's no perspective distortion.

You're free to choose the programming language and environment and may use third party libraries, 
you should be able to explain your solution, though. We're more interested in the approach and its implementation, not so much in a polished and clean interface.
